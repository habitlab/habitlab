Polymer's binding features are only available within templates that are managed
by Polymer.  As such, these features are available in templates used to define
Polymer elements, for example, but not for elements placed directly in the main
document.

In order to use Polymer bindings without defining a new custom element, elements
utilizing bindings may be wrapped with the `dom-bind` template extension.
This template will immediately stamp itself into the main document and bind
elements to the template itself as the binding scope.
