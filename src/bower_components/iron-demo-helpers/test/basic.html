  <!--
    *** Important! ***
    You'll notice that these tests don't use test-fixture. That's because
    there's a problem stamping nested templates in IE/Safari 8. This
    should eventually be patched in webcomponents.js, but in the meantime
    we're going to run these tests "the old way".

    This is relevant because this means that you, as the test writer,
    need to remember that an element's state is maintained between tests.
    If you don't want this, either use a new element, or clean up after
    your test.
