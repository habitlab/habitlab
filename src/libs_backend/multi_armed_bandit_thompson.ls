/**
 * This algorithm recommends interventions using the Generalized Thompson Sampling Algorithm.
 * This Thompson Sampling Algorithm draws inspiration from:
 * Daniel J. Russo, Benjamin Van Roy, Abbas Kazerouni, Ian
 * Osband and Zheng Wen (2018), “A Tutorial on Thompson Sampling”, Foundations and
 * Trends in Machine Learning: Vol. 11, No. 1, pp 1–96. DOI: 10.1561/2200000070.
 * This Thompson Sampling is designed solely for handling a multi-armbed-bandit problem with TIME observations.
 * Currently, we will train the algorithm with all previous sessions on each instance of the extension
 * TODO: Investigate whether this will cause a performance bottleneck and rewrite the algorithm to 
 * maintain the posterior and only train with one new instance each time.

   * Instantiates Thompson Multi Armed Bandit with Prior Distribution Parameters.
   * Note, our observations are time, so we can assume that our observations are log-Gaussian distributed.
   * For each arm (intervention), we will have (mu, sigma) parameters.
   * We will choose our prior parameters to be $$\mu_i=-1/2$$ and $$\sigma_i^2=1$$ so $$E[\theta_i]=1$$
   * for each intervention $$i$$.
   * We will also assume that our sigma_tilde (Gaussian Noise) is 1. TODO: Investigate this assumption.

   * is considered relative to the sampling_factor for recommending an intervention.
